# Bubble Playground
Webpage here:

https://bathinjan.github.io/bubbleplayground/

Bubbles with a randomized pastel RGB color that bounce around the screen

The bubbles will react to mouseover by increasing in size and alpha

Background is transparent; will show as white on a webpage

## Add as an OBS Browser Source:
 - Click "+" icon in sources window
 - Select "Browser"
 - Make sure "Create New" is the selected option
 - Name your browser source (I chose "Bubbles")
 - in the URL field, copy and paste: https://bathinjan.github.io/bubbleplayground/
 - (optional): change width to 1920 and height to 1080, if you'd like fullscreen (you can also resize the window once it's added)
 - **IMPORTANT**: Delete the code in 'Custom CSS'
 - Click Ok

Yay! Bubbles!!

## Note
Touch events currently don't work in Safari on iOS: working on a fix

Works best on a darker background; generated colors are pastel

## Upcoming Features
 - Dark / Light mode: for viewing on a browser
 - Custom Palettes: ability to input custom colors for bubbles
 - Randomization options: bubble velocity, color alphas, array size, etc
 - Non-intrusive customization window for implementing the above
